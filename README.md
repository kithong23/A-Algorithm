# A-Algorithm
Visual representation of the A* search algorithm

This project is created to provide an interactive and visual representation of the A* search algorithm. Users will be able to create obstacles within the boundary of the window before starting the search algorithm. The graphics will display the active search area for each loop, and displays the shortest path when the algorithm has completed the search.
